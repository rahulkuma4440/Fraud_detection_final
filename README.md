The dataset for this project is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data

In this project, I have implemented logistic Regression and Decision Tree algorithm to detect fraudulent transactions and used class balancing techniques like undersampling and oversampling for improving precision and recall score.
